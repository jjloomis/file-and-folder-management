# Connecting to your class folder in a CCL

The Macs in the Campus Computer Labs do not have the Class_Folder icon on the Desktop. Youâ€™ll need to manually connect to your class folder. 

1. On a Mac, click the Desktop to enter Finder mode.
2. Click Go on the menu bar and choose Connect to Server.
3. In the Server Address field, copy and paste the following string (be sure to copy the entire string): <p><pre><code>smb://ufilesls.ad.uwm.edu/LS/Courses/JAMS</code></pre></p>
4. Click Connect. The JAMS drive will appear on the Desktop. 
5. Double-click the JAMS drive on the Desktop. The drive will open in a Finder window. 
6. Double-click your course number folder. (You will not be able to access course number folders for courses in which you are not enrolled.)
7. In the course number folder, your class folder will appear in this format: Lastname-Firstname. Double-click your class folder to open it in a Finder window.
