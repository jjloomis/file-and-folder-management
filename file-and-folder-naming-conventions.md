# File and Folder naming conventions

Servers and multimedia programs sometimes run into problems when file and folder names contain special characters (for example: @, ?, ", /, #, &, etc.)

To avoid these problems, stick to the following characters when naming files and folders:

* Lowercase letters (a-z)
* Numbers
* Hyphens (to be used in place of spaces)

## Example file name

`this-is-a-file.WAV`

## Example folder name

`heres-a-folder`
