# File and Folder naming conventions

Servers and multimedia programs sometimes run into problems when file and folder names contain special characters (apostrophes, slashes, question marks, etc.)

To avoid these problems, use only the following characters when naming files and folders:

* Lowercase letters (a-z)
* Numbers
* Hyphens (to be used in place of spaces)

## Example file name

`this-is-a-file.WAV`

## Example folder name

`heres-a-folder`
