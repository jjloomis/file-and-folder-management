# Copying your project folder to a USB drive

To save a copy of your multimedia project, youâ€™ll need to copy your entire project folder to a USB drive or a Mac-formatted external hard drive (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. will not work.) 

1.	In a Finder window, navigate to your class folder. Then select your project folder. (Note: Be sure to select the folder. Do not navigate to and select items inside your project folder.)
2.	In separate Finder window, navigate to your USB drive or Mac-formatted external hard drive. 
3.	Copy your project folder from your class folder to your USB drive or Mac-formatted external hard drive.
